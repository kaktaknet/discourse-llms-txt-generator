## 📚 About llms.txt

This project implements the **[llms.txt standard](https://llmstxt.org/)** for Discourse forums, making your community content discoverable and accessible to Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI systems.

**What is llms.txt?**

The llms.txt standard is a proposed convention (September 2024, Jeremy Howard from Answer.AI) for providing LLM-friendly content from websites. Think of it as "robots.txt for AI" - a standardized way for websites to expose their content structure to AI systems.

Thousands of sites—including many of the world’s largest and most respected tech companies—have already implemented the llms.txt standard on their own domains. Examples include:
- ✅ Amazon AWS — `https://docs.aws.amazon.com/llms.txt`
- ✅ Cloudflare — `https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt`
- ✅ Stripe — `https://stripe.com/llms.txt`
- ✅ Angular — `https://angular.dev/llms.txt`
- ✅ Redis — `https://redis.io/llms.txt`
- ✅ Docker — `https://docs.docker.com/llms.txt`
- ✅ Model Context Protocol — `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt`

When industry giants adopt a standard at scale—long before it becomes “official”—it’s a clear signal that llms.txt solves a real and urgent problem. Such companies never roll out sitewide initiatives lightly; they always have a solid strategic reason. The rapid, large-scale embrace of llms.txt across the tech industry shows just how important structured content for AI has become, and that the industry itself is driving this adoption forward—even faster than formal standards bodies.

## 🎯 What This Does

This Discourse plugin automatically generates **LLM-friendly documentation files** for your forum:

### 1. **Main Navigation File** (for AI discovery)
`/llms.txt` - A structured overview helping LLMs understand your forum's organization, categories, and latest discussions.

### 2. **Full Content Index** (for AI training)
`/llms-full.txt` - Complete forum index with all topics, categorized and ready for LLM consumption.

### 3. **Dynamic Resource Files** (for targeted content)
Generate llms.txt for **any category, topic, or tag** on-demand:
- `/c/category-name/123/llms.txt` - All topics in a category
- `/t/topic-slug/456/llms.txt` - Complete topic with all posts
- `/tag/tutorial/llms.txt` - All topics with specific tag

### 4. **Sitemap Index** (for crawler discovery)
`/sitemaps.txt` - Complete list of all llms.txt URLs for efficient AI crawler indexing.

**The Result:** Your forum content becomes discoverable by ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI systems, improving GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) and increasing visibility in AI-generated responses.

---

## 💡 Why You Need This

### The Problem Without This

**Before:**
- AI systems can't efficiently understand your forum structure
- LLMs parse HTML pages (slow, inefficient, error-prone)
- Your valuable community knowledge stays hidden from AI
- AI chatbots can't cite or reference your discussions
- No control over how AI systems access your content

### The Solution With This

**After:**
- ✅ Clean, structured, LLM-friendly content format
- ✅ AI systems understand your forum organization instantly
- ✅ Your content appears in ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI responses
- ✅ Control what AI systems see (bot blocking, content filtering)
- ✅ Better GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) for AI discovery

### Real-World Impact

**Before (without llms.txt):**
```
User: "How do I install XYZ on Ubuntu?"
AI: "I don't have specific information about XYZ installation..."
```

**After (with llms.txt):**
```
User: "How do I install XYZ on Ubuntu?"
AI: "According to the XYZ Forum, here are the installation steps:
     [Detailed answer from your forum]
     Source: https://your-forum.com/t/ubuntu-install/123"
```

**Your forum gets:**
- 🎯 Increased visibility in AI responses
- 🔗 Direct attribution and backlinks
- 📈 More traffic from AI-powered search
- 🌟 Recognition as authoritative source

## Generated Files

### `/llms.txt` - Navigation File (Lightweight)

Provides a structured overview of your forum:
- Site metadata and description
- Introduction text
- **Categories with Subcategories** - Hierarchical tree structure
- **Latest 50 Topics** - Most recent discussions (configurable)
- Links to additional resources
- Link to full content file

**Example structure:**
```markdown
# My Forum
> Forum description

Introduction text...

## Categories and Subcategories
### [General Discussion](link)
Description of category

- [Help & Support](link): Support subcategory
- [Feature Requests](link): Requests subcategory

## Latest Topics
- [Topic Title](link) - Category Name (2025-11-09)
- [Another Topic](link) - Another Category (2025-11-08)
...
```

---

### `/llms-full.txt` - Full Content File

Contains complete forum index in simplified format:
- **Custom forum description** (optional, appears first)
- **Categories and subcategories** with detailed descriptions
- **Topic list** in format: `**Category** - [Title](link)`
- **Optional post excerpts** (up to 500 characters) - disabled by default

**Why simplified format?**
LLMs can follow links to read full topic content when needed. This approach:
- Reduces file size significantly
- Speeds up generation (no post processing)
- Prevents overwhelming LLMs with too much text
- Allows LLMs to selectively read topics of interest

**Example format without excerpts (default):**
```markdown
**[General Discussion](url)** - [Welcome to our community](url)
**[Help & Support](url)** - [How to install on Ubuntu](url)
```

**Example format with excerpts enabled:**
```markdown
**[General Discussion](url)** - [Welcome to our community](url)
  > Welcome everyone! This is a place where you can introduce yourself...

**[Help & Support](url)** - [How to install on Ubuntu](url)
  > This guide will walk you through installing our software...
```

- Listed in robots.txt as `Sitemap:` directive
- Automatically updated when content changes
- Respects same privacy and blocking rules

---

## Dynamic llms.txt Files

One of the most powerful features: **virtual llms.txt files for any resource**.

### How It Works

These files **don't physically exist** on your server - they're generated on-demand when requested:

| URL Pattern | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `/c/{category-slug}/{id}/llms.txt` | Category with all its topics | `/c/general-discussion/1/llms.txt` |
| `/c/{parent}/{child}/{id}/llms.txt` | Subcategory | `/c/support/installation/15/llms.txt` |
| `/t/{topic-slug}/{id}/llms.txt` | Complete topic with all posts | `/t/how-to-install/123/llms.txt` |
| `/tag/{tag-name}/llms.txt` | All topics with specific tag | `/tag/tutorial/llms.txt` |

### Example: Category llms.txt

Request: `https://forum.com/c/support/2/llms.txt`

Generates:
```markdown
# Support
> Category: My Forum

Get help with installation, configuration, and troubleshooting.

**Category URL:** https://forum.com/c/support/2
**Canonical:** https://forum.com/c/support/2
**Original content:** https://forum.com/c/support/2

## 🔬 Advanced Topics

### SEO & Canonical URLs

**We've taken care of search engine duplicate content concerns:**

Every dynamic llms.txt file includes canonical URL information in two ways:

**1. HTTP Link Header:**
```http
Link: <https://forum.com/t/topic-slug/123>; rel="canonical"
```

The server automatically sends a `Link` header with `rel="canonical"` pointing to the original forum resource URL. Search engines and AI crawlers recognize this standard header and understand that:
- The llms.txt file is derivative/supplementary content
- The canonical (original) content is at the forum URL
- They should attribute content to the forum URL, not the llms.txt URL

**2. Content Footer:**
```markdown
**Canonical:** https://forum.com/t/topic-slug/123
**Original content:** https://forum.com/t/topic-slug/123
```

At the bottom of each dynamic llms.txt file, we explicitly state the canonical URL and original content location. This helps:
- AI systems understand content provenance
- Search engines avoid duplicate content penalties
- Users and developers see the source of truth

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No SEO penalty for duplicate content
- ✅ Proper attribution to your forum
- ✅ Search engines index the canonical URL
- ✅ AI systems link back to original content
- ✅ Complies with web standards (RFC 6596)

---

### Bot Control & Blocking

**What it is:**
A setting that allows you to block specific AI crawler bots from accessing your `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` files, while still allowing them to access your main forum.

**Why would you want to block bots?**

1. **Quality Control**: Some AI bots provide poor attribution or misrepresent content
2. **Competitive Reasons**: You might not want certain AI services using your content
3. **Bandwidth**: Reduce load from aggressive crawlers
4. **Testing**: Block bots during testing phase before opening to all

**How it works:**

The plugin automatically generates `robots.txt` rules for each blocked bot:

```
# LLM Documentation Files
Allow: /llms.txt
Allow: /llms-full.txt
Allow: /sitemaps.txt
Allow: /c/*/llms.txt
Allow: /t/*/llms.txt
Allow: /tag/*/llms.txt

Sitemap: https://your-forum.com/sitemaps.txt

# Blocked bots for llms.txt files
User-agent: Omgilibot
Disallow: /llms.txt
Disallow: /llms-full.txt
Disallow: /sitemaps.txt
Disallow: /c/*/llms.txt
Disallow: /t/*/llms.txt
Disallow: /tag/*/llms.txt

User-agent: ChatGPT-User
Disallow: /llms.txt
Disallow: /llms-full.txt
Disallow: /sitemaps.txt
Disallow: /c/*/llms.txt
Disallow: /t/*/llms.txt
Disallow: /tag/*/llms.txt
```

**Important:** These bots can still crawl and index your **main forum content** - they're only blocked from the `llms.txt` files.

**How to configure:**

1. Navigate to: Admin → Settings → Plugins → discourse-llms-txt-generator
2. Find: `llms_txt_blocked_user_agents`
3. Enter bot names separated by commas: `Omgilibot, ChatGPT-User, AnotherBot`
4. Save settings
5. Check your `/robots.txt` to verify rules were added

**Common bots you might want to block:**
- `Omgilibot` - Omgili web crawler
- `ChatGPT-User` - OpenAI's ChatGPT crawler (if you prefer API access only)
- `CCBot` - Common Crawl bot
- `anthropic-ai` - Anthropic's crawler
- `Google-Extended` - Google's AI training crawler

**Note:** Bot blocking is advisory - well-behaved bots will respect robots.txt, but malicious crawlers might ignore it.

---

### Smart Cache Management

**How it works:**

The plugin uses intelligent caching to balance performance and freshness:

#### Automatic Hourly Checks

Every hour, a background job runs and checks:
1. **Was there new content?**
   - Checks if any topics were created since last update
   - Checks if any categories were updated since last update

2. **If YES → Update cache:**
   - Clears old cached navigation
   - Regenerates `llms.txt` with new content
   - Updates timestamp
   - Logs: `[llms.txt] Updating cache due to new content`

3. **If NO → Skip update:**
   - Keeps existing cache
   - Saves server resources
   - Logs: `[llms.txt] No new content, skipping cache update`

#### Manual Cache Clear

Cache is also cleared immediately when:
- A new post is created
- A post is edited
- Settings are changed

#### Why This Matters

**Old approach (every request):**
```
User requests /llms.txt
  → Generate file (slow, 1-2 seconds)
  → Return to user
Every request = regeneration!
```

**New approach (smart caching):**
```
Hourly job runs:
  → Check: "New topics since last hour?"
  → NO: Skip regeneration (save resources)
  → YES: Regenerate and cache

User requests /llms.txt:
  → Return cached version (instant, <50ms)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Files stay fresh (max 1 hour old)
- ✅ Faster response times (cached)
- ✅ Less server load (only regenerate when needed)
- ✅ Automatic updates (no manual intervention)

#### Monitoring Cache Updates

Check logs to see cache activity:
```bash
tail -f /var/www/discourse/logs/production.log | grep llms.txt
```

You'll see:
```
[llms.txt] Updating cache due to new content
[llms.txt] Cache updated successfully
```
or
```
[llms.txt] No new content, skipping cache update
```

---

### Performance Optimization

#### Caching

- Navigation file (`llms.txt`) is cached for 60 minutes by default
- Full content file is generated on-demand (not cached due to size)
- Cache is automatically cleared when posts are created/edited

#### Optimization Tips

1. **Set appropriate limits**: Don't include all content if you have a large forum
2. **Adjust minimum views**: Filter out low-quality topics
3. **Monitor access**: Check analytics to see how often files are accessed
4. **Use CDN**: Consider CDN caching for frequently accessed files

#### Resource Usage

- Small forum (<1000 topics): Negligible impact
- Medium forum (1000-10000 topics): ~1-2 seconds generation time for full file
- Large forum (>10000 topics): Use "small" or "medium" posts_limit setting

---

### Custom Forum Description

**What is it?**
An optional text field that appears at the top of your `llms-full.txt` file, right after the site title and description.

**Why do you need it?**
LLMs work best when they have clear context about what your forum is about. This field allows you to provide:
- The main purpose of your forum
- What topics are discussed
- Who your target audience is
- Any special focus areas or expertise

**What to write:**
✅ **GOOD examples:**
```
This forum is dedicated to discussing Python programming, with focus on
web development, data science, and machine learning. Our community includes
beginners and experienced developers sharing practical solutions and best practices.
```

```
A technical support community for XYZ Software users. We help troubleshoot
installation issues, configuration problems, and provide guides for advanced features.
Members range from new users to certified administrators.
```

❌ **BAD examples (avoid these):**
```
🎉 Join the BEST community ever! 🚀 Amazing discussions!
Limited time offer - sign up now! [This is marketing spam]
```

```
We are the world's leading #1 forum with millions of experts!
[This is exaggeration/false claims]
```

**How LLMs use this:**
When an LLM reads your `llms-full.txt`, it first reads this description to understand the context. This helps it:
- Give more accurate answers about your forum
- Better match user queries to your content
- Understand the expertise level of discussions

**Configuration:**
- Navigate to: Admin → Settings → Plugins → discourse-llms-txt-generator
- Find: `llms_txt_full_description`
- Enter: 2-4 sentences describing your forum factually
- Leave empty if you don't need it (optional field)

---

### Integration with Discourse

#### Robots.txt

The plugin automatically adds entries to robots.txt via view connector:

```
# LLM Documentation Files
Allow: /llms.txt
Allow: /llms-full.txt
Allow: /sitemaps.txt
Allow: /c/*/llms.txt
Allow: /t/*/llms.txt
Allow: /tag/*/llms.txt

Sitemap: https://your-forum.com/sitemaps.txt
```

Or if indexing is disabled:

```
# LLM Documentation Files
Disallow: /llms.txt
Disallow: /llms-full.txt
Disallow: /sitemaps.txt
Disallow: /c/*/llms.txt
Disallow: /t/*/llms.txt
Disallow: /tag/*/llms.txt
```

#### Sitemap.xml

Automatically adds entries to sitemap:

```xml
<url>
  <loc>https://your-forum.com/llms.txt</loc>
  <priority>1.0</priority>
  <changefreq>daily</changefreq>
</url>
<url>
  <loc>https://your-forum.com/llms-full.txt</loc>
  <priority>0.9</priority>
  <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
</url>
<url>
  <loc>https://your-forum.com/sitemaps.txt</loc>
  <priority>0.8</priority>
  <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
</url>
```

#### Analytics

The plugin tracks:
- Access count for each file
- Last access timestamp
- User agent (via server logs)

Access stats via Rails console:

```ruby
PluginStore.get("discourse-llms-txt-generator", "access_count_index")
PluginStore.get("discourse-llms-txt-generator", "access_count_full")
PluginStore.get("discourse-llms-txt-generator", "last_access_index")
```

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### Private Content Protection

**Your private categories and topics are SAFE**:

✅ **Private categories** (`read_restricted: true`) are **completely excluded** from:
- `/llms.txt` - Latest topics list
- `/llms-full.txt` - Full content index
- `/sitemaps.txt` - Sitemap index
- `/tag/{name}/llms.txt` - Tag-based topic lists

✅ **Topics from private categories** will **never appear** in public llms.txt files

✅ **Dynamic files** (per-category/topic) use **Guardian permission checks**:
- `/c/{category}/llms.txt` → Returns 404 for unauthorized users
- `/t/{topic}/llms.txt` → Returns 404 for unauthorized users

✅ **Automatic updates**: When you change a category from private to public, topics automatically appear in public files (within cache refresh time)

### Security Features

- **Respects Discourse Permissions**: Only includes publicly accessible content

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Files not accessible

**Symptoms:**
- `/llms.txt` returns 404
- `/llms-full.txt` not found

**Solutions:**

1. **Check plugin is enabled:**
   ```
   Admin → Settings → Plugins → llms_txt_enabled = true
   ```

2. **Verify indexing is allowed:**
   ```
   Admin → Settings → llms_txt_allow_indexing = true
   ```

3. **Check plugin installation:**
   ```
   Admin → Plugins → Look for "discourse-llms-txt-generator"
   ```

4. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f /var/www/discourse/logs/production.log | grep llms
   ```

### Issue: Empty or incomplete content

**Symptoms:**
- Files exist but show no topics
- Missing categories

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify you have public topics with sufficient views:**
   - Topics must have at least `llms_txt_min_views` views (default 50)

2. **Check minimum views setting:**
   ```
   Admin → Settings → llms_txt_min_views
   ```
   If too high, lower it to include more topics

3. **Check posts limit:**
   ```
   Admin → Settings → llms_txt_posts_limit
   ```
   Try changing to "medium" or "all"

4. **Ensure categories are public:**
   - Private categories (`read_restricted: true`) are excluded
   - Check: Admin → Categories → [Category] → Security

---

### Issue: Performance issues

**Symptoms:**
- Slow generation times
- High server load
- Timeouts

**Solutions:**

1. **Reduce posts limit:**
   ```
   Admin → Settings → llms_txt_posts_limit = "small" or "medium"
   ```

2. **Increase minimum views:**
   ```
   Admin → Settings → llms_txt_min_views = 100
   ```
   Filter out low-quality topics

3. **Disable excerpts:**
   ```
   Admin → Settings → llms_txt_include_excerpts = false
   ```

4. **Increase cache duration:**
   ```
   Admin → Settings → llms_txt_cache_minutes = 120
   ```

### Issue: robots.txt doesn't show llms.txt entries

**Symptoms:**
- `curl https://forum.com/robots.txt` doesn't show "LLM Documentation Files"

**Solutions:**

1. **Clear robots.txt cache:**
   ```bash
   cd /var/www/discourse
   rails runner "Rails.cache.delete('robots_txt')"
   ```

2. **Use plugin rake task:**
   ```bash
   bundle exec rake llms_txt:refresh
   ```

3. **Restart Discourse:**
   ```bash
   cd /var/discourse
   ./launcher restart app
   ```

4. **Verify after 30 seconds:**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-forum.com/robots.txt | grep -A 10 "LLM Documentation"
   ```
